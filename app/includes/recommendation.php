    <p>I can attest to his work ethic and dedication to fully understanding and executing the desired software project. He was responsible for performing the necessary research and background on several infrastructures and databases within Hardin Scientific and deploying company resources to execute the desired outcome within the allotted budget. I strongly recommend Michael for his work ethic and attention to detail.</p>

    <p>Michael join Hardin Scientific to help us to build the corporate news portal. Our goal was to design and develop textual data pipeline via web scraping (Python script). The system had to store (Mongo, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and filter real dataflow (KNIME, Python) to show up stream of publications on the corporate website (PHP, HTTP). Michael successfully passed through the all necessary milestones of the project and completed it right on time.</p>
